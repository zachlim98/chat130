Adopt t he rule of “Identify, \\nVerify , and Activate” when selecting any handles or switches. \\nDo not bunt the nose excessively to counter the effects of \\nservices during the gear s or flap s transition to prevent overstress. \\nRemember to trim out the aircraft while carrying out the checks .

The mental model should be subsequently refined with each circuit call received. When calling for circuit entry at high key, aircrew are reminded that aircraft that have completed the base turn call are not included as downwind traffic provided by ATC;\\nd) ATC responds to base turn traffic with sequencing information on traffic ahead. \\nCircuit aircraft should not enter the base turn before all base RT, including read-back requirements, is complete, and the crew have sighted and can remain clear of preceding traffic;\\ne) Aircraft joining via the base leg of the circuit should make the base call prior to \\nintercepting the normal base turn profile when still clear of other circuit traffic and/or aircraft on extended final (i.e. approximately 4 track miles from touch down);\\nf) Aircraft assigned an approach or landing clearance with traffic ahead are to keep \\npreceding traffic forward of the 3–9 line;\\ng) Alerted see-and-avoid procedures are not applied to aircraft positioning for a \\nPractise Forced Landing until they have reported at High Key. Prior to reaching High Key within the CIRA, segregation may be achieved by using a lateral boundary (e.g.remaining on opposite sides of the runway centreline) or, if no convenient lateral boundary is available, tactical segregation criteria detailed at PLN 8.7 are to be applied;\\nh) Tactical segregation parameters detailed at Para 3.8.6 do not apply to aircraft joining \\nvia initial, as sequencing of arrivals is managed by APP. Furthermore, segregation with other traffic is facilitated by following a prescribed dead-sidetrack and altitude and flying at standardised speeds;\\ni) Aircraft unable to complete the base turn call, acknowledge sequencing \\nrequirements, and visually identify all preceding traffic should abandon the approach and advise going around from downwind/base, manoeuvring as required to remain behind preceding traffic. Aircraft are to advise ATC if unable to remain behind the preceding traffic; and\\nj) IFR departure and approach procedures are not positively separated from VFR \\ncircuit area traffic.

The checks are broken up between the LAPA scan to maintain awareness of the aircraft parameters, including fuel checks and scanning the 'G' recorded on the PFD 'G' meter.
