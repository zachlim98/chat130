Introduction . In general, when handling engine related EPs, \\naircrew should task prioritise flying the aircraft to a key position \\n(or 1:1). They will then refer to the EP checklist and E-Matrix if \\ntime and capacity allows. Once established in key position, \\naircrew should prioritise flying the PFL/FL to a safe touchdown. \\n \\n3.2. Land Back .  \\n \\n3.2.1. Land back is generally attempted when the aircraft experiences \\na critical engine malfunction such that useable thrust cannot be \\nproduced to safely climb to low key (example flameout). A \\nland back may be attempted when landing gears are down and \\nthere is sufficient runway remaining.  \\n \\n3.2.2. When engine fails during takeoff, the aircraft reverts to Mode \\n3 braking, with a landing distance of approximately 3348ft \\n(referencing AFM landing ground roll distance of 3100ft in \\nMode 2 + 8% for manual braking). As a rule of thumb, to \\njudge sufficient runway remaining, we need to make sure we \\nhave approximately 4000ft of runway available. \\n \\n3.2.3. At Pearce airfield, the Tacan station is approximately 4000ft \\ninto the main runway (RWY 18L/36R), therefore the Tacan \\nstation can be used as a visual cue to determine whether there \\nis approximately 4000ft of runway remaining. For short \\nrunways like runway 05/23 and Gin Gin, 4000ft of runway \\nremaining occurs very quickly approximately 2-3seconds after \\nlift off from a take-off or touch & go. \\n \\n3.2.4. Flaps may be lowered to landing position to reduce the stalling \\nspeed for landing, if doing so will not sacrifice the execution \\nof a safe landing. \\n \\n3.2.5. Land back should only be performed by QFI because of their \\nexperience level. Trainees should consider ejection as a safer \\noption due to low experience level. \\n \\n3.3.

Land Back .  \\n \\n3.2.1. Land back is generally attempted when the aircraft experiences \\na critical engine malfunction such that useable thrust cannot be \\nproduced to safely climb to low key (example flameout). A \\nland back may be attempted when landing gears are down and \\nthere is sufficient runway remaining.  \\n \\n3.2.2. When engine fails during takeoff, the aircraft reverts to Mode \\n3 braking, with a landing distance of approximately 3348ft \\n(referencing AFM landing ground roll distance of 3100ft in \\nMode 2 + 8% for manual braking). As a rule of thumb, to \\njudge sufficient runway remaining, we need to make sure we \\nhave approximately 4000ft of runway available. \\n \\n3.2.3. At Pearce airfield, the Tacan station is approximately 4000ft \\ninto the main runway (RWY 18L/36R), therefore the Tacan \\nstation can be used as a visual cue to determine whether there \\nis approximately 4000ft of runway remaining. For short \\nrunways like runway 05/23 and Gin Gin, 4000ft of runway \\nremaining occurs very quickly approximately 2-3seconds after \\nlift off from a take-off or touch & go. \\n \\n3.2.4. Flaps may be lowered to landing position to reduce the stalling \\nspeed for landing, if doing so will not sacrifice the execution \\nof a safe landing. \\n \\n3.2.5. Land back should only be performed by QFI because of their \\nexperience level. Trainees should consider ejection as a safer \\noption due to low experience level. \\n \\n3.3.
