The EC's main rotor turns clockwise when viewed from the\\ntop of the helicopter, causing an anti-clockwise torque reaction which would\\nrequire an opposing thrust force to counteract the spinning tendency of the\\nfuselage (See Figure 1A-1). This thrust force is produced by the tail rotor which\\ncomes in the form of a shrouded (Fenestron) tail rotor on the EC.\\nFigure 1A-1: Torque reaction\\nDirection of\\nBlade\\nRotation\\nTorque\\nReaction\\nTail Rotor\\nThrust Force\\n1A.3 Fenestron tail rotor. The Fenestron tail rotor, is a high speed, variable pitch\\nducted fan mounted in a cambered fin. The trademarked anti-torque system differs\\nfrom a conventional tail rotor in that it typically has several additional rotor blades\\nthat are smaller in size but rotate at much higher speeds. With reference to Fig\\n1A-2, the EC's Fenestron tail rotor consists of a dynamic section (tail rotor hub\\nand blades) and a fixed section (the stator and TGB support).

The negative camber of the horizontal stabilizer then damps this\\nmovement by creating an opposing downward force to keep the fuselage at a more\\nlevel attitude to minimise parasitic drag and widen the CG range of the aircraft.\\nIn a hover, the stabilizer's stability helps prevent the fuselage from following\\nthrough when a gust of wind causes the rotor disc to flap back. As the fuselage\\nbegins to pitch up, the increasing angle of attack on the stabilizer will damp down\\nthe movement and the rearward tilt of the disc will be greatly reduced.\\nNonetheless, it is important to note that as a result of the main rotor downwash\\nexerting a force on the tail stabilizer causing a tail-down moment, the helicopter\\nin the hover generally adopts a nose-up attitude. In rearward flight or tailwind\\nconditions, caution must be exercised as the horizontal stabilizer can press the tail\\ndownward, resulting in a tail strike.\\nFigure 1A-3: Horizontal stabilisier\\nGurney\\nFlap\\nNegative\\nCamber\\n1A.5 Gurney flaps.

The collective lever or collective (commonly referred) controls\\nthe blade pitch and hence the Total Rotor Thrust (TRT - Lift) produced by the\\nrotor. Movement of the collective simultaneously alters the pitch of all the blades\\nby the same amount through individual pitch operating arms connected to the\\nrotating swash plate. The rotating plate may be raised or lowered or have its angle\\nchanged by a non-rotating swash plate below (See Figure 2-3). The collective is\\nalso hydraulic servo-assisted and stays at the applied position when raised or\\nlowered. There is a friction knob located at the base of the collective that allows\\ncrew to adjust the collective friction level. The friction should not be set too tightly\\nsuch that raising or lowering the collective in emergency situations requires\\nadditional effort.\\nFigure 2-3: Rotor head detail\\nPitch\\nOperating Arm\\nSleeve and Spindle\\nFeathering\\nHinge\\nRotating\\nSwash Plate\\nNon-rotating\\nSwash Plate\\nControl Rods\\n2.10 Effects of collective. When the collective is raised, there is not only an\\nincrease in TRT but also an increase in rotor drag, resulting in a reduction in NR.\\nHowever, the governor will automatically regulate the fuel supply to maintain NR\\nwithin normal operating range. This increases the FLI. The reverse occurs when\\nthe collective lever is lowered.\\n2.11\\nIn straight and level flight, as the collective is raised, both the disc and\\naircraft attitude pitches up and the helicopter climbs. As torque is being applied\\nto the rotor shaft, there is an equal and opposite reaction applied on the helicopter\\nby the rotor shaft.

To achieve forward flight, forward cyclic is input leading\\nto a forward tilt of the rotor disc and hence TRT. This leads to an initial imbalance\\nof the forces when compared to that in a hover. The initial effects of the transition\\nfrom a hover to forward flight will be covered in later chapters.\\nPitching\\nMoment\\nFigure 3-1: Forces in balance in forward motion\\nTRT\\nVertical Component\\nTRT Vertical Component\\nHorizontal\\nThrust\\nCG\\n>Parasite Drag\\nHorizontal\\nComponent\\nCG\\n>I Parasite\\nDrag\\nStabiliser\\nWeight\\nWeight Y.\\na.\\nAs seen in the Figure 3-1 above, in transition to forward flight, the\\nvertical components of TRT and AUW remain in line but a couple now\\nexists between the horizontal component of TRT and fuselage parasite\\ndrag as forward speed increases. The fuselage will continue to pitch\\nforward but the moment will be opposed by the vertical components of\\nTRT and AUW. This pitch forward will stop once the couples are in\\nbalance i.e. when the TRT is in line with the CG. In addition to this, the\\nhorizontal stabiliser, with its negative camber, will produce a downward\\nmoment reducing the forward pitch of the fuselage. As such, at a said\\nforward speed, the helicopter will fly with a fixed nose down attitude.\\nMovements in CG may affect this balancing moment thereby affecting the\\nnose down attitude.\\n3-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='8dc6ddf0-8eb8-4c32-9fed-df760ae6b710', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 27}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='86ec6929-7fe1-4a50-ac78-155fcb83e472', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 27}, hash='188d66cb1eab20b36e9a53d21137969c22ae38b982c07d9a881f667b8bb90e45')}, hash='188d66cb1eab20b36e9a53d21137969c22ae38b982c07d9a881f667b8bb90e45', text=\"OFFICIAL (CLOSED)\\n3.3\\nFactors affecting maximum forward speed. There are several factors,\\nsimilar to fixed wing that limit the maximum forward speed. These include control\\nlimits (max forward cyclic), engine power available and airframe structural\\nstrength. In the helicopter, one other factor known as airflow reversal limits max\\nforward speed.\\nFigure 3-2: Blade tip vs blade root\\nVR - Vw\\nVw\\n-\\nForward\\nAir Speed\\nAirflow\\nReversed\\nAngle of Attack\\nat Blade Tip\\nAngle of Attack Close\\nto Blade Root\\nVr at Blade TIP\\nVr Close to Blade Root\\nVR +Vw\\na.\\nAir flow reversal. The speed of rotation of the retreating blade is\\nhigh at the tip and low at the root (see Figure 3-2), but the airflow from\\nforward flight will have an equal value for the whole length of the blade.\\nAt high forward speeds when the airflow from forward flight is greater\\nthan the blade's rotational velocity (at the blade root due to its lower\\nrotational velocity) the net airflow will be from the trailing edge to the\\nleading edge leading to airflow reversal. At higher airspeeds this reversal\\nmoves over a progressively large section of the blade leading to a greater\\nloss of thrust. When the helicopter is then further accelerated with more\\nforward cyclic or even putting it into a dive, a phenomenon known as\\nretreating blade stall occurs.\\nFigure 3-3: Retreating blade stall\\nArea and\\nPattern of\\nStall\\nForward\\nAir Speed\\n3-2\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='8e2d04c0-41c0-4dbf-acb8-d1e8ee77b9e0', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 28}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='6e4b83ef-de71-40ee-9d2c-288a2af5ae8c', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 28}, hash='42749f1fbfef3dd4059babe19e9338d31984fa0fc785801eeaabe6cbfb286ec9'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='326ae2a5-6616-4011-8a1d-09aca5c71d15', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 28}, hash='20a51fa0db912715396862489e82dfff722e029628a04868f0aae276e7943dc5')}, hash='eb2bab92c89045c7f7f1433a41a4d3ee3f6c08f90648eeb2a23c02e9abe854d5', text=\"OFFICIAL (CLOSED)\\nb.\\nRetreating Blade stall. As airspeed continues to increase and the\\nAOA of the retreating blade is increased with collective, a speed will be\\nreached where the airflow breaks away and the blade stalls (see Figure 3-\\n3). The stall will cause the blade to flap down drastically due to the sudden\\nloss of lift. Lead indicators of retreating blade stall include airframe and\\ncontrol vibrations and erratic cyclic stick movement. Once fully\\ndeveloped, the helicopter may pitch up suddenly, roll to the retreating\\nblade side (right roll on the EC) and lose height rapidly. The main recovery\\naction will be to lower the collective and attempt to reduce speed with aft\\ncyclic input. Other than excessive forward speed (<VNE), retreating blade\\nstall can also occur in the following conditions:\\n1. High G manoeuvres\\n2.

It is critical\\nto autorotate during emergencies that render the engine ineffective, when the anti-\\ntorque effect of the tail rotor needs to be eradicated in a tail rotor control failure\\nor when a rapid descent is required.\\n5.2\\nObjectives. (1) From straight and level flight, enter and establish\\nautorotation at 65kts, (2) From straight and level flight, establish autorotation at\\n65kt and turn to complete an 180º heading change and (3) Recover from an\\nautorotation and establish a climb.\\nAERODYNAMICS OF AUTOROTATION\\n5.3\\nThe explanation as to how the blades continue to turn in autorotation can\\nbest be demonstrated through the hypothetical situation where the helicopter is\\nautorotating vertically downwards in still air. The various airflows and angles\\nwhich will be referred to are shown in Figure 5-1.\\nFigure 5-1: Blade cross section during autorotation\\nAxis of\\nRotation\\n-\\nRate of\\nDescent Airflow\\nPitch Angle\\nRotational Airflow\\nRelative\\nAirflow\\nInflow\\nAngle\\n1\\n----\\n1\\nAngle of\\nAttack\\nPlane of\\nRotation\\na.\\nInflow angle and Relative airflow.

For a helicopter to hover (See Figure 6-1), a force must\\nbe produced by the rotors (TRT) such that it is able to oppose and exceed the force\\nexerted on the helicopter due to gravity (Nt, All up weight - AUW). The raising\\nof the collective to establish a hover leads to an increase in the AOA of the blades\\nand hence TRT. Once TRT > AUW, the helicopter climbs. To maintain a hover\\nat a specified height, collective pitch must be reduced to adjusted such that TRT\\n= AUW. However, the environment in which the helicopter hovers and the effect\\nof the downwash produced by the rotor blades affects the TRT and hence the\\npower required in a hover.\\nFigure 6-1: Forces in a hover\\nTRT\\nV Nt\\n6.4\\nGround effect. The effect of the helicopter's own rotor downwash on TRT\\nwhen hovering close to the ground or in still free air is referred to as 'ground\\neffect'.

In the hover, the helicopter will roll about the horizontal couple until the\\nmovement is balanced by the couple of the vertical component of total rotor thrust\\nand the helicopter all up weight (see Figure 6-9).

Hovering should always be\\ncarried out in an open area clear of obstacles. Initial hover practice will be done\\nat 6ft while the standard hover height for the EC is 5ft. To maintain ground\\nposition with a hover, the following steps will need to be followed:\\na.\\nLateral and forward reference. Lateral and forward reference\\nmarkers are essential to maintaining ground position. As a guide, a\\nprominent feature at the helicopter's 2 or 10'o clock position about two\\nrotor diameters from the aircraft can serve as a good lateral reference. In\\nthe airfield, ground markings and taxyway or marker boards can be used.\\nA forward reference, at the 12' o clock position and at a significant\\ndistance from the aircraft should also be selected. This can be larger\\nfeatures such as tall trees or buildings.\\nb.\\nCyclic. On identifying the forward and lateral references, the\\ncyclic will be used to maintain the hover attitude and reference features,\\nthereby maintaining the hover picture. Control inputs must be small and\\ngentle to avoid excessive drift or pilot induced oscillations (PIO). If PIO\\nsets in, look far ahead, reduce cyclic movements to stop the PIO before\\nattempting to hover again.\\nc.\\nDrift Correction. When a drift is recognised, always correct the\\nhover attitude first by inputting cyclic opposite to the direction of drift.\\nForward and aft drift will be determined through the apparent movement\\nof the lateral reference (See Figure 6-11). Left and right drift will be\\ndetermined through the apparent movement of the heading reference point\\n(See Figure 6-12).Scan the appropriate references to ensure the drift has\\nstopped.\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='8cc375ea-6770-411e-9ed4-40767cc80356', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 62}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='4246dfbf-40af-4238-a0ad-5d99983d3ec5', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 62}, hash='68477d88f0a46fbb297213d9c37c4a3375494b75cca170819db1207bbbcb9cfb'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c2f74233-a1e5-485a-a034-2b174640355e', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 62}, hash='6338356c327c716c40886e47384e41f34c559eb5d08113e3114fc692f3dd5e76')}, hash='f584493f64b58d07d8016bee94e3767def13581c3cd7d7f0cc94d9564225a336', text=\"If the area allows, re-select references and maintain a hover at\\nthe new position.

Take-off and landing in a helicopter involves getting airborne\\nto a hover and landing back from a hover. The objectives are (1) from the ground,\\ntake-off to a 5ft hover and (2) from a 5ft hover, land the helicopter while\\nmaintaining ground position.\\nHELICOPTER BEHAVIOUR DURING TAKE-OFF AND LANDING\\n7.2\\nTake-off. In a hover, the TRT = AUW. To get airborne from the ground,\\nthe TRT must exceed AUW leading to a net climb vector in the vertical axis\\nthereby allowing the helicopter to break ground and hover. It is vital to take note\\nof the following aerodynamic effects during this process:\\na.\\nAnti-torque. As the collective is raised to get airborne, the TRT\\nand hence lift from the main rotor will increase. Correspondingly, the\\ntorque reaction of the fuselage in the opposite direction to the main rotor's\\nrotation will increase. To counter this, the tail rotor thrust has to be\\nincreased through inputting opposing pedal to the torque reaction or in the\\nsame direction as the rotor. For the EC, too little pedal input will lead to a\\nleft yaw once the skids break ground while too much may lead to a right\\nyaw and corresponding increase in engine torque.\\nb.\\nTail Rotor Drift and Tail rotor roll. As covered in hovering, due to\\ntail rotor thrust and vertical displacement between the tail rotor and main\\nrotor, the helicopter will drift to the left (for clockwise turning rotors as in\\nthe EC) and roll right when getting airborne to a hover.

Prior to the skids contacting ground, the\\nhelicopter will need to be stabilised at a low hover height (approximately\\n2 to 3ft). This will cause a marked increase in the divergent duct below\\nthe fuselage leading to an increase in induced flow and hence the ground\\neffect. Similarly, due to the closer proximity to the ground, recirculation\\nat the blade tips will also increase.

Dynamic Rollover may cause a helicopter to be\\nirreversibly committed to rolling over at angles below 10°, depending on the rate\\nof roll.

The main\\nproblems encountered with excessive backwards speed are:\\na.\\nAttitude Control. Attitude control at high backwards speeds can be\\nseen as two distinct problems:\\n(1)\\nPitch down during backwards flight. As the backward\\nflight speed increases, progressively more aft cyclic is required to\\nmaintain the aircraft attitude as the blades flap forward. The\\nreduction or even nil rotor wash from the main rotor impacting on\\nthe horizontal stabilizer results in a lower nose down attitude than\\nthe initial selection. A point could be reached where there is\\ninsufficient aft cyclic available to prevent the aircraft from\\npitching down. With a fully forward C of G this will occur at a\\nlower backward flight speed.\\n(2)\\nPitch down when stopping backwards flight. To stop the\\naircraft, forward cyclic must be input. This causes the aircraft to\\npitch down. However, the helicopter does not stop immediately\\nand continues to experience a backward motion. This causes the\\nhelicopter to pitch down further compounded by relative airflow\\nstriking the under of the horizontal stabilizer. This pitch down can\\nbe significant and depends on the airspeed and degree of the initial\\naircraft attitude. Even at very slow backward speeds and with very\\ngentle cyclic movements, this effect is noticeable. If an excessive\\nnose down attitude is experienced the helicopter will descend.\\nBefore this stage is reached, raise the collective and climb to a\\nsafer height.\\nGROUND MANQUEVRING\\n8.6\\nApplication to hover. Hovering in a crosswind or tailwind is the direct\\napplication of sideways and backwards flight. When hovering out of wind, the\\ncyclic is always displaced into wind similar to it being displaced in the direction\\nof movement at a pace equivalent to the wind. The pedal position and sensitivity,\\nand aircraft attitude depend on the wind direction.

Generally, helicopters are designed to\\nconduct spot turns about the vertical axis of the main rotor. However, through\\ncoordinated movements of the cyclic and pedals, the axis can be shifted to varying\\npoints on the helicopter itself or even about a feature or reference marker outside.\\n8.9\\nZero Wind Condition. To understand power and control variations in a\\nspot turn, consider a spot turn in zero wind condition. This will require constant\\npedal application in the direction of turn to achieve a constant rate of turn through\\n360°. The ground position and height are controlled with the cyclic and collective\\nrespectively. In the EC, a spot turn to the right will produce a slight increase in\\nFLI / torque (refer to Figure 8-2). This is due to the tail rotor having to increase\\nthe anti-torque effect to turn the aircraft clockwise. A turn to the left will result in\\na slight decrease in FLI / torque.\\nFigure 8-2: Right pedal variation in a turn with zero wind\\nR pedal\\ninput\\nZero-wind\\nHover datum\\nNeutral\\nHeading\\n8.10\\nWeathercock Effect. In the presence of wind, the same constant rate of\\nturn would be achieved with variations in pedal input. This is as the vertical fin\\nwould encounter wind from changing directions during the turn translating to\\nvariations in the weathercock effect. As such, to maintain the constant turn rate,\\nvariations in pedal input would be required at different phase of the turn.

Separate to flapback, when the helicopter starts to transit\\nforward, the horizontal airflow across the forward tilted disc causes a reduction in\\nthe induced flow. However, this reduction is not uniform because air passing\\nacross the top of the disc is being continually 'sucked in' by the action of the\\nrotors. Thus air which is moving horizontally towards the disc will cause the\\ngreater reduction in induced flow at the front of the disc, and the smallest\\nreduction at the rear of the disc (See Figure 9-2). Because of the increased AOA\\nin the front to the disc compared to the rear (flapping to equality), the disc will\\nbegin to flap up at the front and flap down towards the rear (clockwise turning\\nrotors).

As a reminder, in our example, the 2250 kg light H/C\\nwith 10 m/sec of average downwash velocity in hover (10 m/sec = 2000 fpm) will meet VRS conditions at about\\n1000 fpm. This should not mean that one can descend safely at (say) 900 fpm just because the limit is 1000 fpm.\\nFor various reasons (see next section about aggravating factors) and most importantly in order to conserve\\nsafety margins as a general rule, one should never conduct a final approach below 25-30 kts with a RoD\\ngreater than 500 fpm.\\n1\\nIn the VRS mapping graph below, an example (typical of a light helicopter) of the VRS range (red) with associated\\nmargins (amber) is plotted as a function of airspeed and rate of descent (RoD).

The terminal phase of the autorotation involves a technique\\nknown as the 'flare recovery'. The objective of this technique is to harness the\\nkinetic energy from the forward motion of the helicopter to sustain autorotative\\nflight when nearer the ground and thereafter the energy of the autorotating blades\\nto execute a safe touchdown. This is made possible due to the following\\naerodynamic effects in a flare:\\na.\\nThrust Reversal. By easing the cyclic aft, the horizontal\\ncomponent of total rotor thrust will now act in the same direction as\\nparasite drag, causing the groundspeed to reduce rapidly. This will be\\naccompanied by a pitching up of the fuselage because reverse thrust is\\nbeing maintained while parasite drag decreases as groundspeed decreases.\\n(See Figure 11-1).\\nFigure 11-1: Reversal of TRT\\nTRT\\nVertical Component\\nHorizontal Component\\nTRT\\nParasite Drag\\nParasite Drag\\nAirspeed\\nWeight\\nWeight\\n11-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='8958e7f7-fe21-4c11-87a8-64de165f57e7', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 112}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='56a9f7b5-98c6-43b7-b36c-60bd9bb6f7d9', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 112}, hash='201d15d5a45dc45f12f95fde2a65c48914ab4f88642a4c4054baac5416725c5d')}, hash='201d15d5a45dc45f12f95fde2a65c48914ab4f88642a4c4054baac5416725c5d', text=\"OFFICIAL (CLOSED)\\nb.\\nIncrease in Total Rotor Thrust. The tilt back of the disc during\\nforward flight will change the airflow relative to the disc. A component of\\nthe horizontal airflow will now pass through the disc at right angles to the\\nplane of rotation which will reduce induced flow. The resultant tilting of\\nthe total reaction towards the axis of rotation will cause an increase in total\\nrotor thrust. (See Figure 11-2)\\nFigure 11-2: Increase in TRT and reduction in rotor drag\\nTotal Reaction\\nMoves Towards\\nAxis of Rotation\\nRotor Thrust\\nIncreased\\nDrag\\nLift\\n--------\\nTotal Reaction\\nIF\\nReduced\\nComponent of\\nHorizontal Airflow\\nPlane of\\nRotation\\nRotor Drag\\nDecreased\\nc.\\nIncrease in Rotor RPM. Rotor RPM will increase rapidly during\\nthe flare due to conservation of angular momentum and reduction in rotor\\ndrag.\\n(1)\\nConservation of Angular Momentum. An increase in total\\nrotor thrust causes the blades to cone up. The radius of the blades'\\nCG from the shaft axis decreases and the rotational velocity will\\nautomatically rise.\\n(2)\\nReduction in Rotor Drag. Rotor drag is reduced in the flare\\nbecause the total reaction moves towards the axis of rotation. The\\nforward movement of the total reaction vector causes the rotor\\ndrag component to be reduced. (See Figure 11-2)\\n11.4 In summary, in a flare, an autorotating helicopter slows down rapidly first.\\nThis leads to an in increase in the incident ROD airflow due to the pitch up of the\\ndisc attitude. The blades produce more lift and shortly after, the rotor rpm begins\\nto rise giving the helicopter more energy as it gets closer to the ground.

Instead, at low level, forward speed and flare effects are\\nrelied on to successfully autorotate. The sequence is as follows:\\na.\\nCircuit. Low level autos commences at 200ft AGL. In SBAB, this\\ntranslates to 300ft AMSL. A normal circuit or a low level circuit can be\\nconducted for the set up. On downwind, conduct the HFIPAL checks.

In reality, due to the dynamism of flight profiles,\\nachieving these specific datum would be rare.

As covered in basic autorotation, the EC achieves\\nminimum ROD when autorotating at 65kts (Endurance speed in Figure\\n12-3). Speeds below 65kts will lead to a higher ROD and a substantial\\nreduction in range. At speeds above 65kts, the ROD will increase at a\\nmuch lower rate than the corresponding increase in range till 90kts (See\\nFigure 12-4). In a PFL, to manage the range (kinetic energy) vs ROD\\n(potential energy) balance in an autorotation, the speed variation\\ntechnique, with 65kts as the datum is employed.\\nFigure 12-4: Height loss vs range\\nHEIGHT\\n90kts\\n65kts\\n40kts\\nRANGE\\n(1)\\nHigh potential energy. At 65kts in autorotation, if the\\nhelicopter has altitude to lose with insufficient forward distance to\\ncover, a higher ROD with a reduction in range is required. This\\ncan be achieved through a reduction of speed to 40kts. The low\\nforward speed and high ROD allows the helicopter to lose height\\n(potential energy) while reducing ground distance covered. This is\\nthe speed reduction technique.\\n(2)\\nLow potential energy. If the helicopter has forward speed\\nbut insufficient height to lose, maximum ground distance must be\\ncovered while minimising height loss. In the EC, this is achieved\\nat the range speed of 90kts. In an actual engine failure, the\\ncollective can be raised to achieve NR at 340 so as to further\\nextend the range.\\nb.\\nIntercepting 65kts glide path. In an engine failure, the speed\\nreduction technique is employed so as to manage the helicopter's energy\\nstate with the key objective being to intercept the 65kt autorotative glide\\npath. This is required to harness the full effect of the flare and accuracy of\\nranging hence ensuring the correct execution of the terminal phase of the\\nengine off landing.

In all of these conditions, it may not be\\nfeasible to employ the basic transition technique due to limitations in the engine\\npower available or availability of forward distance. In such scenarios, advanced\\ntransition techniques are employed.\\n13.2\\nObjective. The objectives are; (1) determine the power margin available\\nthrough hover and forward flight power checks, (2) select the appropriate\\nadvanced transition technique, (3) conduct a OGE, IGE, cushion creep and\\nrunning take off transition to the climb and (4) conduct a transition from forward\\nflight to an OGE hover, zero speed and running landing.\\nPOWER DEMANDS IN A HELICOPTER\\n13.3 Prior to learning advanced transition techniques, an understanding of\\npower demands in a helicopter will need to be established:\\na.\\nRotor profile power. This is the power required to drive the main\\nrotors at minimum pitch at a constant NR in addition to the power required\\nto drive the tail rotor and other ancillary equipment. Generally, the rotor\\nprofile power remains at about the same value throughout the speed range\\nwith minor increases in demand at higher airspeeds.\\nb.\\nInduced power. To increase rotor thrust for hover or forward\\nmotion, the blade pitch must be increased leading to an increase in rotor\\ndrag. As such, to maintain NR more power must be produced to overcome\\nthe rising drag of the blades. This increase in power is known as induced\\npower as it is the power required to overcome the rise in drag when the\\nblades induce air to flow through the rotor. However, induced flow\\ndiminishes with forward speed and therefore the induced power.\\nc.\\nParasite power. Parasite drag, due to the airframe, increases as\\nforward airspeed increases. As such, the disc would need to be tilted\\nfurther forward to increase the horizontal component of TRT leading and\\n13-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='cdac7542-3436-40dc-bb4c-f5a6d425deaa', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 144}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='4b0e4d82-931b-4189-b5be-288c5e3d2972', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 144}, hash='ce0867e4566173043dc7430ee15e3a4f88bbd460f62c7a5da8a30ef6cd825571')}, hash='ce0867e4566173043dc7430ee15e3a4f88bbd460f62c7a5da8a30ef6cd825571', text=\"OFFICIAL (CLOSED)\\na corresponding increase in rotor drag.

The helicopter's performance, through the speed range, is\\ndetermined by the relationship between the power available and power required.\\nThe power available is constant throughout as it is based off the maximum power\\nthe engine can provide the rotor. Figure 13-2 below shows that the greater the\\ndifference between power available and total power required, the greater the\\npower margin. In normal operating conditions, there will be a surplus of power\\navailable at all speed ranges providing the helicopter the required power margin\\nto conduct manoeuvres and approaches. The key figures to note are:\\na.\\nPoint 1 - Best ROC speed where the maximum margin is\\navailable. This is also the best endurance speed and best climb speed (Vy)\\nas it is the lowest point on the power required curve.\\nb.\\nPoint 2 - Maximum forward speed (Vmax), when no power\\nmargin is available.\\nc.\\nPoint 3 - Range speed at the tangent of the datum line between\\nTAS and power.\\n13-2\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='f2d24021-1889-4492-ab33-2567a1c92cf2', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 145}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5239722b-a192-4487-911b-fa18e6f4f021', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 145}, hash='95945af5019cefff6acf84232fab893359962bf7c5cff32e5d09c94f4879df05')}, hash='95945af5019cefff6acf84232fab893359962bf7c5cff32e5d09c94f4879df05', text='OFFICIAL (CLOSED)\\nFigure 13-2: Power available vs power required\\nPower Available\\n2\\nHover (OGE)\\nHover (IGE)\\nPower\\nMargin\\nMaximum Power\\nMargin\\nPower\\nRequired\\n4\\n3\\n1\\nPower\\nTAS-\\nEndurance\\nSpeed\\nRange Speed Maximum\\n(Still Air)\\nStraight &\\nLevel Speed\\n13.6\\nLimited power.

Verbalise the power margin and the target power (this may\\nbe the max power available or the 65kts S&L power + 2.6 FLI) for\\nthe transition.\\n(2)\\nObstacle height. Simulate an obstacle >2/3 rotor diameter,\\nimmediately ahead of the aircraft. As a guide, a 40ft obstacle\\nheight can be used. The target height to terminate will therefore be\\n50ft. Ensure this is verbalised.\\n(3)\\nNormal approach. Conduct a normal circuit and line up on\\nfinals at 500ft, 65kts (+/- wind component) for the assigned\\nplatform.\\n(4)\\nReference markers.

Downwind transitions are to be\\navoided due to the hazards of lower tail rotor control authority, higher power\\nrequirements due to the earlier loss of translational lift and the higher risk of\\nmeeting the conditions for VRS6.

The CG directly affects the cyclic position in a hover.\\nFor the EC, a CG displaced to the right would mean more left cyclic is\\nrequired to maintain ground position in a hover.

If internal loads are picked up or off-loaded after landing, the\\nlateral cyclic range will vary due to the change of CG. This must be\\ncalculated and checked on the ground prior to flight. Fuel tanks can also\\ncause unbalanced loading laterally due to the gravitational flow of fuel to\\nthe down slope side of the tank. This shift in CG varies, depending on the\\nfuel load, the gradient of the slope and the length of time the aircraft has\\nbeen laterally inclined.

In helicopters, navigation is conducted at lower\\naltitudes, slower speeds and at times even relying on terrain features to mask the\\nhelicopter enroute (to be covered in terrain flying).\\n15.2\\nThe objectives are; (1) plan a medium and low level navigation route and\\n(2) fly and navigate between a departure and arrival point at medium and low\\nlevel.\\nDEFINITIONS AND ROLES\\n15.3\\nDefinitions. The two main types of navigation practiced in helicopters are\\nmedium level and low level navigation. Low level navigation includes the\\nemployment of terrain flying modes, the details of which will be covered in the\\nrelevant chapter. Other than a difference in operating heights, the specifics of each\\ntype of navigation are:\\na.\\nMedium Level. Involves navigation safely above terrain using\\nenroute navigation aids or ground features or a combination. Timings are\\nmonitored using leg timings and the estimated time of arrival (ETA) at the\\ndestination is amended based on actual leg timings. Medium level\\nnavigation is employed for longer route flights such as overseas\\ndeployments or cross country flights.\\nb.\\nLow Level. Low level flying in the RSAF is limited to 500ft AGL\\nor 100ft above highest obstacle (AHO1), whichever is higher, unless\\nauthorised by HQ RSAF. Helicopters are permitted to conduct terrain\\nflying, defined as flying below 200ft AHO. Low level navigation in\\nhelicopters is carried out at 150ft AHO up to a speed of VNE. Running\\ntime is used throughout the route and speed is adjusted to make good the\\n1 Details are elaborated in the terrain flight chapter.\\n15-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='09ed18cd-6cd6-4979-9321-a79e881104e2', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 179}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='8eb3006b-7add-4cea-967c-527de9671fd4', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 179}, hash='99c3fd938e14cc6ca172d82016629d0969f27e620918c9b3d028d9a9261d2097'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='edc9bad2-d5c5-40e5-b8db-397404493053', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 179}, hash='64963977590f1aa96faf8bb269b79c9bddd3b2953be2c55ea105ace2e914f0c9')}, hash='8bd7c1811d6945b8c8febbbd84a08831392b50d40e929cc9d24bbd60433d809c', text='OFFICIAL (CLOSED)\\nETA at waypoints and the eventual arrival destination. Locally, low level\\nnavigation is conducted at 500ft AMSL.\\n15.4\\nFuel Figures. Fuel is vital in navigation planning. The key terms to take\\nnote of are:\\na.\\nFuel required (FR). This is the fuel required to fly the navigation\\nbased on fuel at start-up and thereafter deducting the fuel consumed per\\nleg. Fuel state below FR would mean the helicopter is consuming more\\nfuel than planned. This may occur due to a change in environmental\\nconditions or even AUW. Crew should then closely monitor their FRCS.\\nb.\\nFuel required to complete sortie (FRCS). Also known as the bingo\\nfuel, it is the minimum fuel required to fly the sortie as per the planned\\nnavigation route. It is calculated by starting with the fuel requirements\\n(minimum fuel catering for diversion and other regulatory requirements)\\nat the arrival airfield and adding the fuel needed to complete the route as\\nper the planned navigation route. Dropping to FRCS would require an\\nimmediate recovery as per the planned route.\\nc.\\nChicken fuel. This is the fuel to fly a direct leg to the destination,\\nfrom the furthest point on the navigation route and arrive at the destination\\nbefore reaching minimum fuel. It is typically used for routes in navigation\\ntraining that start and end at the same point.\\n15.5\\nMinimum safe altitude (MSA). This is the altitude that provides a safety\\nheight clearance above the highest obstacle in the area or leg. Leg MSA is derived\\nby taking the highest obstacle within 10nm of each leg of the route, rounded up\\nto the nearest 100ft and adding 1500ft. A similar method can be used for route\\nMSA, based off the highest obstacle within 10nm of the entire route. For cross\\ncountry navigation flights, the appropriate VFR or IFR charts and regulations\\nneed to be referred to for the regulatory requirements of MSA.\\n15.6 Roles. In the helicopter dual crew cockpit, clear designation of roles for\\nnavigation flights is required.

In both cases, the general area of operations should be clearly\\nidentified. Next, airspace requirements such as minimum heights, airspace\\nclasses, gazetted areas and authorisation for low level navigation training should\\nbe addressed. Locally, SAFTI LFA is used for EC navigation training due to\\nrestrictions on single engine helicopter operations overland. On selecting the AO\\nbased on the navigation objective, the next step will be planning the route.\\n15.8\\nSelection and Preparation of Maps. The appropriate map should be used\\nfor navigation planning and execution. The lower the map resolution (determined\\nby the scale), the higher the altitude flown when using it. The type of maps and\\ncriteria for selection are:\\na.\\nIFR or VFR Charts. These are published airway charts that have\\nminimal terrain details but focus instead on navigation using Nav aids or\\nGPS routes. They are typically not used for navigation exercises, less\\nplanning for overseas deployments.\\nb.\\nTactical Pilotage Charts (TPC). The scale of TPC maps is\\n1:500,000 or 1:1,000,000. These charts are designed for fixed wing low\\nlevel and medium level navigation. The L10C is a TPC that covers the\\nSingapore region.

Prior to embarking on terrain flying, crew must\\nunderstand the potential hazards and watch areas when flying at low heights.\\nThese should be factored in the mission and route planning while being effectively\\nmitigated against prior to execution. The main watch areas are:\\na.\\nWires. Power lines, antennae and communication wires pose a\\ngrave threat to helicopter terrain flying.\\n(1)\\nOn the ground, these should be clearly marked on the\\nhazard map, the flying map and aircraft navigation systems (if\\nable). As a norm, wires should be avoided at all cost.\\n(2)\\nAt low heights, it is difficult to visually acquire wires as\\nthey are thin, long and easily blend in with the surrounding terrain.\\nNever attempt to fly under wires. If there is a need to, cross them\\nobliquely at the poles or pylons at least 50ft above. In addition,\\nslow down when approaching a known area with wires to allow\\nmore reaction time for any unmarked wires.\\n(3)\\nAs a CRM practice, the NFP (navigator) should call out\\n\"wires\" with the distance ahead while the FP should echo or call\\nout \"visual of wires, climbing/crossing at pylon/pole\".\\n17-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='29d7145e-bcbd-4ac4-9473-7d188828a9a7', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 206}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='51232943-da67-4527-949a-f5276e24c9ee', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 206}, hash='0564a181f0ff27f4a91fe3e9d9c45b087bda3ec82a581be1ece4c434e06f71e2')}, hash='0564a181f0ff27f4a91fe3e9d9c45b087bda3ec82a581be1ece4c434e06f71e2', text='OFFICIAL (CLOSED)\\n(4)\\nVisibility. Flying at lower heights can lead to reduced\\nforward visibility due to ground dust or pollution, low level mist\\nor fog over a dense canopy and even sun angles during sunrise or\\nsunset. All of these conditions pose as a hazard to terrain flying.\\n(a)\\nTake note of the time of the planned terrain flight\\nto cater for sun angle. Meteorological updates may help\\nalert crew to possible moisture related phenomenon over\\nterrain or the jungle.\\n(b)\\nRoutes nearer populace, deforestation or natural or\\nman-made fires will likely lead to visibility issues. If\\nencountered when flying, reduce speed if able and assess\\nif a higher height can be flown to cater to poorer visibility.\\nb.\\nWind. Terrain flying downwind at slow airspeeds requires more\\npower (due to higher induced power requirements below endurance\\nspeed), thus reducing overall endurance.\\n(1)\\nDowndraft and turbulence are to be expected on the\\nleeward side of hills and over forests during high wind conditions.\\nThe forecast winds and utilisation of on-board systems such as the\\nEFIS will aid to mitigate against this hazard from the planning\\nstage to real time execution. For e.g. in SAFTI LFA, terrain flying\\nnear the leeward side of the terrain feature at LS Lam Kiong when\\nprevailing winds are from the north can lead to crew experiencing\\nsudden descends. This can be mitigated against through route\\nplanning prior to flight. If encountered in flight due to real time\\nweather changes, climb to a higher height and slow down.\\n(2)\\nWind also affects ground track more at lower levels. This\\ncan be demonstrated when flying a race track pattern at terrain\\nflight mode.\\nFigure 17-1: Track drift\\nWind\\nD\\nC\\nB\\nA\\n17-2\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='0f844ead-2757-4f4b-9ba0-cb1ff230212e', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 207}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a630f955-9d55-4615-a19d-28412faa4823', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 207}, hash='3782b4a006162be9a3a3c91427306cec4388b0c9cacd0ec779590256bcbe562f')}, hash='3782b4a006162be9a3a3c91427306cec4388b0c9cacd0ec779590256bcbe562f', text='OFFICIAL (CLOSED)\\n(3)\\nTrack drift.

It is\\ntypically employed for tactical purposes and allows two or more aircraft to\\nmaintain tactical integrity while providing mutual coverage in high threat\\nenvironments. Tactical formation forms the foundation for the employment of\\nformation flying in multi helicopter missions.\\n19.2 Objectives. The objectives are: (1) station keeping in tactical left, tactical\\nright and trail, (2) Turns and basic manoeuvres in a 2-ship formation, (3) stream\\nlanding and take-off, (4) 2-ship contingencies such as aircraft emergencies, no-\\nradio, break and re-join and inadvertent IMC and (5) delivery of the tactical\\nformation mission brief.\\nTYPES OF FORMATION\\n19.3\\nClose formation. Close formations are employed in tactical situations to\\nreduce the radar signature of a multi aircraft package. It is applicable more to fixed\\nwing due to their ability to get close in formation without compromising aircraft\\nperformance or safety. In contrast, helicopters rely on terrain features to minimise\\nsignature. The wake from a helicopter's downwash can also adversely impact\\nother helicopters coming close to it. As such, close formation is not regularly\\npracticed in helicopter flying.\\n19.4 Display formation. The objective of these is to maintain a formation for\\nthe purposes of aerial shows or displays. They are flown anywhere from two to\\nfive rotor spans between the helicopters. The focus is for the wingman or trailing\\nmembers to maintain the designated separation and features for station keeping\\nwhile the lead typically focuses on achieving a TOT. Common display formation\\npositions are echelon left / right, line astern, Vic, diamond and staggered left /\\nright.\\n19.5\\nTactical formation. Tactical formations are used to maximise the tactical\\neffectiveness of multiple helicopters in formation. The helicopters are spaced out\\nsuch that sufficient manoeuvring space is afforded to allow the formation to\\n19-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='0ffc504a-9414-4022-8c17-32eba546a128', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 232}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='253de17d-b84a-4fc9-a0f2-4a9b51a1fca9', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 232}, hash='4be33deb318c7e39fa7e338c1921c80c3a4218ff5a5ad03902c869b58673e7de')}, hash='4be33deb318c7e39fa7e338c1921c80c3a4218ff5a5ad03902c869b58673e7de', text=\"OFFICIAL (CLOSED)\\nmaintain tactical integrity, employ the required individual tactics while operating\\nsafely in terrain flying modes.

The basic unit of a tactical formation is a two ship section or\\nelement. Two or more elements make up a flight.\\n19.7\\nSpacing. Helicopters in formation maintain and measure spacing using\\nrotor diameter. Tactical formations (T'form) utilise five rotors as the minimum\\nspacing in the air and minimum of two rotors between taxying helicopters. The\\nfive rotor spacing on the EC can be accurately demonstrated utilising the space\\nbetween two marker boards on the grass lanes in SBAB (See Figure 19-1 below).\\nFigure 19-1: Five rotor spacing on lanes\\n150ft\\n10ft\\n5 rotors = 165ft\\n200ft\\n10ft\\n19.8 Rotor wash.

Forward transitions to the climb by the lead must be done\\nslower than normal. A shallower climb out, slower than normal acceleration and\\nhence lower power should be employed by the lead so as to allow trailing\\nhelicopters to have the required margin to catch up. Conversely, the leader should\\nfly a shallower approach angle, slightly faster than normal approach speed to\\nprevent the wingman from having to rapidly decelerate or even lose sight of the\\nlead at the later stages of the transition to land. This may lead to conditions for\\nvortex ring. The specific techniques to be employed will be covered in succeeding\\nsections of the chapter.\\n19.10 Manoeuvring Limitations. As the EC will be used to introduce basic\\ntactical formation, the lead should limit his turns to 30° AOB to prevent the\\nwingman from having to turn too steeply, especially during inboard turns. Re-\\njoins (from break and re-join) in turns are also disallowed.\\nEXECUTION: GROUND AND DEPARTURE\\n19.11 Mission Preparation. Actual tactical formations are employed during\\nmission oriented training. The considerations would hence be premise on tactical\\nconsiderations utilising the METTT-C framework. For tactical formation training,\\nthe following main factors should be taken into account:\\na.\\nObjectives. Sortie objectives and profiles should be as per detailed\\nin the syllabus or crew training requirements. The wingman and lead's\\nobjectives should both be taken in account when defining objectives for\\nthe mission.\\nb.\\nArea. The largest training area available is preferred for tactical\\nformation. The area should allow straight legs to practice station keeping\\nand sufficient height for manoeuvring in a formation. Locally, LATA 'A'\\nand/or SAFTI LFA are typically assigned for tactical formation sorties.\\nc.\\nHelicopter.

The helicopter's performance which includes\\nairspeed, attitude, height, heading and balance are all monitored through an\\neffective scan pattern of the instruments. The selective radial scan pattern begins\\nwith and is centred on the Attitude Indicator (AI). Thereafter, other instruments\\nsuch as the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) in an instrument approach can be\\nscanned before returning to the AI. In accordance with the RSAF Instrument\\nFlying Reference Manual (RFIRM), 80% of the FP's attention should be\\nmaintained on the AI.\\n20.5 PFD setting. On the EC, the AI is recommended to be set to basic mode\\nfor IF training. This declutters the display from other information such as the drift\\ncursor and provides vital performance information required for basic IF scanning.\\nThe scan pattern (white arrows), parameter indications and markers on the AI are\\nas depicted in Figure 20-1.\\n20-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='cef62b95-f3e9-4e9f-8a6a-1f407ca0640b', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 258}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a49351f4-ec0e-4e43-860c-09480f7d4e09', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 258}, hash='9429516d874b6581a61d27383f32b64e328ea4e6a773b6455bd4c2355baad21d')}, hash='9429516d874b6581a61d27383f32b64e328ea4e6a773b6455bd4c2355baad21d', text='Turn Indicator\\nSpeed Tape\\n119\\n104\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)\\nFigure 20-1: Instrument scan pattern\\nPitch Indicator\\n120\\n20\\n110\\n104\\n90\\n65\\n120\\n1\\n1\\nCO\\n5900\\n29.88\\n55\\n80\\nAOB Indicator\\nAltitude Tape\\n5900\\n80\\nHeading Tape\\nS\\n70\\n10L\\n110\\nFMS2\\n1.

The Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) provides a relative\\nbearing to the Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) station signal as well as an audio\\noutput of the received signal.\\n20A.3 Errors and Limitations.\\na.\\nDip Error. The ADF bearing should be considered accurate only\\nwhen the aircraft is in level flight due to \"dip error\" when the aircraft is\\nbanked and most noticeable when the station is on the nose or tail of the\\naircraft. This is because the loop antenna which rotates to sense the\\ndirection of the incoming signal is mounted so that its axis is parallel to\\nthe normal axis of the aircraft.\\nb.\\nShorelines. Shorelines can also refract or bend low frequency radio\\nwaves as they pass from land to water. Pilots flying over water should not\\nuse an NDB signal that crosses over the shoreline to the aircraft at an angle\\nless than 30°. The shoreline has little or no effect on radio waves reaching\\nthe aircraft at angles greater than 30°.\\nc.\\nMountains/Cliffs. Mountains or cliffs can reflect radio waves,\\nproducing a terrain effect. Pilots flying near mountains should use only\\nstrong stations that give definite directional indications, and should not\\nuse stations obstructed by mountains.\\nd.\\nThunderstorms. Water droplets and ice crystals circulating within\\na storm cloud generate wideband noise which may affect accuracy of\\nADF. Lightning within the thunderstorms will also cause the needle to\\npoint for a moment to the bearing of the lightning due to high power\\noutput.\\n20A.4 Phases of an NDB Approach.

The human eye transits from day vision to night vision\\nwhen ambient lighting decreases. The human eye thus utilises slightly different\\ncomponents within the eye to perceive vision. In this mode, certain this false\\ninformation may be perceived due to the limitations of the eyes and unfamiliarity\\nin a night environment. It is therefore imperative that crew understand the\\nillusions one may encounter so as to avoid or be able to recognise the onset of the\\nsymptoms. The following are some possible illusions:\\na.\\nRelative Motion. This illusion occurs when an object within view\\nmoves relative to other objects with no reference to the surroundings. This\\ncan occur in the day when an adjacent large vehicle moves, relative motion\\ncan be perceived as movement of own vehicle in opposite sense. In the\\nfigure shown below, movement of the aircraft in view may be perceived\\nas opposite movement of own aircraft when there is a lack of visible\\nfeatures in peripheral vision.\\nFigure 21A-1: Relative Motion\\nb.\\nConfusion with Ground Lights. When flying over a sparsely\\ninhabited area, the lack of prominent man made features like towns and\\ncities presents the pilot with a sparsely lit terrain.

Another\\nexample is when a helicopter is wrongly identified to be a large helicopter\\nlike a CH53, when in fact it is a much smaller helicopter with a similar\\nsilhouette. The brain misconceives this and tells you that the helicopter is\\nfar way, based on its retinal image size.\\nh.\\nFlicker Vertigo Lights that flicker at a rate of between 4 to 20\\ncycles per second can cause nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, flicker\\nvertigo had resulted in convulsions and unconsciousness. Flicker vertigo\\ncan be caused by steady lights flickering when viewed through the rotor\\nblades or when the anti-collision light flickers against the background in\\nIMC conditions. The solution is to remove the source of the flicker.\\ni.\\nFascination or Fixation This occurs when the pilot focuses on a\\ntarget or area of interest and disregards other orientation cues. Target\\nfixation is generally reported in gunnery sorties with the pilot focused on\\nthe target. It can also occur if a pilot attempts to make an approach to a\\nlight source with a breakdown in scan leading to the disregard of other\\norientation and approach cues.\\nj.\\nReversible Perspective Illusion. This usually occurs when a pilot\\nviews an aircraft flying an almost parallel course. The pilot may mistake\\nan approaching aircraft for one flying away. This is because the silhouette\\ndoes not provide sufficient visual cues to the pilot. In the example below,\\nthe aircraft could be flying towards or away from the viewer as shown,\\nbased on the viewer's mindset and perception of visual cues available.\\nFigure 21A-7: Reversible Perspective Illusion\\nk.\\nAltered Planes of Reference When a horizon is not clear to the\\npilot, his plane of reference may be altered by the visual references\\navailable to him. In the example below, the pilot is approaching a\\nridgeline, and although he is able to clear the ridgeline, the lack of a datum\\n(ie. horizon) to reference off from may cause the pilot to start a climb and\\nfly a flight path above what is actually necessary.\\n21-A-5\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='96de727b-844c-4ef0-b795-5b11f121f6db', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 294}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a0dc0489-5a56-446f-8530-b88987099c41', node_type=None, metadata={'total_pages': 319, 'page': 294}, hash='6a7c35b536cdeeea2b900f4bcf4e1091762e4c9afb51bffda8fbd3a0a00df056')}, hash='6a7c35b536cdeeea2b900f4bcf4e1091762e4c9afb51bffda8fbd3a0a00df056', text='OFFICIAL (CLOSED)\\nFigure 21A-8: Altered Planes of Reference\\nActual flight path\\nIntended flight path\\nLack of horizon\\n21A.2 Night Flying Techniques.

Located on the tail boom, the horizontal stabilizer\\nis designed with a negative camber to provide pitch axis stability for the aircraft.\\nIn forward flight, when the cyclic disc is tilted forward, the fuselage acts\\npendulously below the main rotor, causing the aircraft attitude to pitch\\ndownwards. The negative camber of the horizontal stabilizer then damps this\\nmovement by creating an opposing downward force to keep the fuselage at a more\\nlevel attitude to minimise parasitic drag and widen the CG range of the aircraft.\\nIn a hover, the stabilizer's stability helps prevent the fuselage from following\\nthrough when a gust of wind causes the rotor disc to flap back. As the fuselage\\nbegins to pitch up, the increasing angle of attack on the stabilizer will damp down\\nthe movement and the rearward tilt of the disc will be greatly reduced.\\nNonetheless, it is important to note that as a result of the main rotor downwash\\nexerting a force on the tail stabilizer causing a tail-down moment, the helicopter\\nin the hover generally adopts a nose-up attitude.

The fuselage will continue to pitch\\nforward but the moment will be opposed by the vertical components of\\nTRT and AUW. This pitch forward will stop once the couples are in\\nbalance i.e. when the TRT is in line with the CG. In addition to this, the\\nhorizontal stabiliser, with its negative camber, will produce a downward\\nmoment reducing the forward pitch of the fuselage. As such, at a said\\nforward speed, the helicopter will fly with a fixed nose down attitude.\\nMovements in CG may affect this balancing moment thereby affecting the\\nnose down attitude.\\n3-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

There are several factors,\\nsimilar to fixed wing that limit the maximum forward speed. These include control\\nlimits (max forward cyclic), engine power available and airframe structural\\nstrength.

The speed of rotation of the retreating blade is\\nhigh at the tip and low at the root (see Figure 3-2), but the airflow from\\nforward flight will have an equal value for the whole length of the blade.\\nAt high forward speeds when the airflow from forward flight is greater\\nthan the blade's rotational velocity (at the blade root due to its lower\\nrotational velocity) the net airflow will be from the trailing edge to the\\nleading edge leading to airflow reversal. At higher airspeeds this reversal\\nmoves over a progressively large section of the blade leading to a greater\\nloss of thrust. When the helicopter is then further accelerated with more\\nforward cyclic or even putting it into a dive, a phenomenon known as\\nretreating blade stall occurs.\\nFigure 3-3: Retreating blade stall\\nArea and\\nPattern of\\nStall\\nForward\\nAir Speed\\n3-2\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For a helicopter to hover (See Figure 6-1), a force must\\nbe produced by the rotors (TRT) such that it is able to oppose and exceed the force\\nexerted on the helicopter due to gravity (Nt, All up weight - AUW). The raising\\nof the collective to establish a hover leads to an increase in the AOA of the blades\\nand hence TRT. Once TRT > AUW, the helicopter climbs. To maintain a hover\\nat a specified height, collective pitch must be reduced to adjusted such that TRT\\n= AUW. However, the environment in which the helicopter hovers and the effect\\nof the downwash produced by the rotor blades affects the TRT and hence the\\npower required in a hover.\\nFigure 6-1: Forces in a hover\\nTRT\\nV Nt\\n6.4\\nGround effect. The effect of the helicopter's own rotor downwash on TRT\\nwhen hovering close to the ground or in still free air is referred to as 'ground\\neffect'.

Take-off and landing in a helicopter involves getting airborne\\nto a hover and landing back from a hover.

In a hover, the TRT = AUW. To get airborne from the ground,\\nthe TRT must exceed AUW leading to a net climb vector in the vertical axis\\nthereby allowing the helicopter to break ground and hover. It is vital to take note\\nof the following aerodynamic effects during this process:\\na.\\nAnti-torque. As the collective is raised to get airborne, the TRT\\nand hence lift from the main rotor will increase. Correspondingly, the\\ntorque reaction of the fuselage in the opposite direction to the main rotor's\\nrotation will increase. To counter this, the tail rotor thrust has to be\\nincreased through inputting opposing pedal to the torque reaction or in the\\nsame direction as the rotor. For the EC, too little pedal input will lead to a\\nleft yaw once the skids break ground while too much may lead to a right\\nyaw and corresponding increase in engine torque.\\nb.\\nTail Rotor Drift and Tail rotor roll. As covered in hovering, due to\\ntail rotor thrust and vertical displacement between the tail rotor and main\\nrotor, the helicopter will drift to the left (for clockwise turning rotors as in\\nthe EC) and roll right when getting airborne to a hover. To correct for this\\ndrift, right cyclic is required leading to an eventual hover with the right\\nskid low. This must be catered to else the helicopter may drift excessively\\nto the left when the skids break ground during the take-off.\\n7.3\\nLanding.

Prior to the skids contacting ground, the\\nhelicopter will need to be stabilised at a low hover height (approximately\\n2 to 3ft). This will cause a marked increase in the divergent duct below\\nthe fuselage leading to an increase in induced flow and hence the ground\\neffect. Similarly, due to the closer proximity to the ground, recirculation\\nat the blade tips will also increase. The helicopter will therefore tend to\\nhave minor erratic movements thereby requiring more manipulation of the\\ncyclic and collective to stabilise the hover. As such, prolonged hover at\\nlow heights should be minimised.\\nb.\\nRight skid contact. Due to the natural right skid low in a hover, the\\nhelicopter will contact ground with the right skid first. It is therefore vital\\nto be gentle in lowering the collective when executing the landing to avoid\\nslamming the right skid to the ground thereafter leading to a rocking\\nmotion once the left skid contacts. This can lead to excessive airframe\\nstress or even damage the skids.\\nAERODYNAMIC HAZARDS\\n7.4\\nDynamic Rollover. Dynamic Rollover may cause a helicopter to be\\nirreversibly committed to rolling over at angles below 10°, depending on the rate\\nof roll. This phenomenon is more likely to occur when landing on or taking off\\nfrom a slope. The key reason for this hazardous phenomenon is the build-up of\\nangular velocity of the helicopter mass about the skid in contact with the ground.\\na.\\nRollover in a take-off.

In both cases, with the right skid in contact, the cyclic would\\nbe biased towards the left to maintain ground position.

The main\\nproblems encountered with excessive backwards speed are:\\na.\\nAttitude Control. Attitude control at high backwards speeds can be\\nseen as two distinct problems:\\n(1)\\nPitch down during backwards flight. As the backward\\nflight speed increases, progressively more aft cyclic is required to\\nmaintain the aircraft attitude as the blades flap forward. The\\nreduction or even nil rotor wash from the main rotor impacting on\\nthe horizontal stabilizer results in a lower nose down attitude than\\nthe initial selection. A point could be reached where there is\\ninsufficient aft cyclic available to prevent the aircraft from\\npitching down. With a fully forward C of G this will occur at a\\nlower backward flight speed.\\n(2)\\nPitch down when stopping backwards flight. To stop the\\naircraft, forward cyclic must be input. This causes the aircraft to\\npitch down. However, the helicopter does not stop immediately\\nand continues to experience a backward motion. This causes the\\nhelicopter to pitch down further compounded by relative airflow\\nstriking the under of the horizontal stabilizer. This pitch down can\\nbe significant and depends on the airspeed and degree of the initial\\naircraft attitude. Even at very slow backward speeds and with very\\ngentle cyclic movements, this effect is noticeable. If an excessive\\nnose down attitude is experienced the helicopter will descend.\\nBefore this stage is reached, raise the collective and climb to a\\nsafer height.\\nGROUND MANQUEVRING\\n8.6\\nApplication to hover.

Generally, helicopters are designed to\\nconduct spot turns about the vertical axis of the main rotor. However, through\\ncoordinated movements of the cyclic and pedals, the axis can be shifted to varying\\npoints on the helicopter itself or even about a feature or reference marker outside.\\n8.9\\nZero Wind Condition. To understand power and control variations in a\\nspot turn, consider a spot turn in zero wind condition. This will require constant\\npedal application in the direction of turn to achieve a constant rate of turn through\\n360°. The ground position and height are controlled with the cyclic and collective\\nrespectively. In the EC, a spot turn to the right will produce a slight increase in\\nFLI / torque (refer to Figure 8-2). This is due to the tail rotor having to increase\\nthe anti-torque effect to turn the aircraft clockwise. A turn to the left will result in\\na slight decrease in FLI / torque.\\nFigure 8-2: Right pedal variation in a turn with zero wind\\nR pedal\\ninput\\nZero-wind\\nHover datum\\nNeutral\\nHeading\\n8.10\\nWeathercock Effect. In the presence of wind, the same constant rate of\\nturn would be achieved with variations in pedal input. This is as the vertical fin\\nwould encounter wind from changing directions during the turn translating to\\nvariations in the weathercock effect.

The VRS mappings that can be found in the\\nliterature are numerous and differing. Nevertheless, they all give a very similar message when it comes to the\\nROD where the H/C can meet VRS conditions at very low speeds (<25-30 kts): the RoD of VRS is about half\\nof the downwash velocity the H/C would have in HOGE. As a reminder, in our example, the 2250 kg light H/C\\nwith 10 m/sec of average downwash velocity in hover (10 m/sec = 2000 fpm) will meet VRS conditions at about\\n1000 fpm. This should not mean that one can descend safely at (say) 900 fpm just because the limit is 1000 fpm.\\nFor various reasons (see next section about aggravating factors) and most importantly in order to conserve\\nsafety margins as a general rule, one should never conduct a final approach below 25-30 kts with a RoD\\ngreater than 500 fpm.\\n1\\nIn the VRS mapping graph below, an example (typical of a light helicopter) of the VRS range (red) with associated\\nmargins (amber) is plotted as a function of airspeed and rate of descent (RoD). An indicative threshold of the loss\\nof reliable anemometry (IAS) is also given. Based on airspeed and ROD we can also add several approach slopes\\nin order to compare with VRS boundaries.

The terminal phase of the autorotation involves a technique\\nknown as the 'flare recovery'. The objective of this technique is to harness the\\nkinetic energy from the forward motion of the helicopter to sustain autorotative\\nflight when nearer the ground and thereafter the energy of the autorotating blades\\nto execute a safe touchdown. This is made possible due to the following\\naerodynamic effects in a flare:\\na.\\nThrust Reversal. By easing the cyclic aft, the horizontal\\ncomponent of total rotor thrust will now act in the same direction as\\nparasite drag, causing the groundspeed to reduce rapidly. This will be\\naccompanied by a pitching up of the fuselage because reverse thrust is\\nbeing maintained while parasite drag decreases as groundspeed decreases.\\n(See Figure 11-1).\\nFigure 11-1: Reversal of TRT\\nTRT\\nVertical Component\\nHorizontal Component\\nTRT\\nParasite Drag\\nParasite Drag\\nAirspeed\\nWeight\\nWeight\\n11-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The tilt back of the disc during\\nforward flight will change the airflow relative to the disc. A component of\\nthe horizontal airflow will now pass through the disc at right angles to the\\nplane of rotation which will reduce induced flow.

The tactical employment of helicopters involves\\noperating at low altitudes over water or terrain. Low level autorotation provides\\nthe technique to autorotate at low altitudes. It differs fundamentally from other\\nautorotations as the helicopter no longer has potential energy to establish an\\nautorotative descent. Instead, at low level, forward speed and flare effects are\\nrelied on to successfully autorotate. The sequence is as follows:\\na.\\nCircuit. Low level autos commences at 200ft AGL. In SBAB, this\\ntranslates to 300ft AMSL. A normal circuit or a low level circuit can be\\nconducted for the set up. On downwind, conduct the HFIPAL checks. For\\nthe H, ensure the commencement height of 300ft AMSL and overshoot\\nheight of 5ft is clearly called out.\\nb.\\nBase. The R/T call will need to include \"low level autos\" at the\\nend.

Ensure the CRM call of \"cleared for\\n<assigned platform>\"is done. At 500ft AMSL, check that the area below\\nis clear of obstacles and if so call out \"clear of obstacles\". Then, continue\\nthe descent to 300ft AMSL maintaining 90kts.\\nc.\\nFinals. Line-up with the cleared platform at 300ft AMSL and\\n90kts. Cross control and straighten the aircraft.

As covered in basic autorotation, the EC achieves\\nminimum ROD when autorotating at 65kts (Endurance speed in Figure\\n12-3). Speeds below 65kts will lead to a higher ROD and a substantial\\nreduction in range. At speeds above 65kts, the ROD will increase at a\\nmuch lower rate than the corresponding increase in range till 90kts (See\\nFigure 12-4). In a PFL, to manage the range (kinetic energy) vs ROD\\n(potential energy) balance in an autorotation, the speed variation\\ntechnique, with 65kts as the datum is employed.\\nFigure 12-4: Height loss vs range\\nHEIGHT\\n90kts\\n65kts\\n40kts\\nRANGE\\n(1)\\nHigh potential energy. At 65kts in autorotation, if the\\nhelicopter has altitude to lose with insufficient forward distance to\\ncover, a higher ROD with a reduction in range is required. This\\ncan be achieved through a reduction of speed to 40kts. The low\\nforward speed and high ROD allows the helicopter to lose height\\n(potential energy) while reducing ground distance covered. This is\\nthe speed reduction technique.\\n(2)\\nLow potential energy. If the helicopter has forward speed\\nbut insufficient height to lose, maximum ground distance must be\\ncovered while minimising height loss. In the EC, this is achieved\\nat the range speed of 90kts.

In an engine failure, the speed\\nreduction technique is employed so as to manage the helicopter's energy\\nstate with the key objective being to intercept the 65kt autorotative glide\\npath. This is required to harness the full effect of the flare and accuracy of\\nranging hence ensuring the correct execution of the terminal phase of the\\nengine off landing.

This is the power required to drive the main\\nrotors at minimum pitch at a constant NR in addition to the power required\\nto drive the tail rotor and other ancillary equipment. Generally, the rotor\\nprofile power remains at about the same value throughout the speed range\\nwith minor increases in demand at higher airspeeds.\\nb.\\nInduced power. To increase rotor thrust for hover or forward\\nmotion, the blade pitch must be increased leading to an increase in rotor\\ndrag. As such, to maintain NR more power must be produced to overcome\\nthe rising drag of the blades. This increase in power is known as induced\\npower as it is the power required to overcome the rise in drag when the\\nblades induce air to flow through the rotor. However, induced flow\\ndiminishes with forward speed and therefore the induced power.\\nc.\\nParasite power. Parasite drag, due to the airframe, increases as\\nforward airspeed increases.

To avoid meeting the conditions for VRS (See chapter on\\nbasic transitions) and not having sufficient power to salvage the situation, a power\\nin hand check is conducted.

The two main types of navigation practiced in helicopters are\\nmedium level and low level navigation. Low level navigation includes the\\nemployment of terrain flying modes, the details of which will be covered in the\\nrelevant chapter. Other than a difference in operating heights, the specifics of each\\ntype of navigation are:\\na.\\nMedium Level. Involves navigation safely above terrain using\\nenroute navigation aids or ground features or a combination. Timings are\\nmonitored using leg timings and the estimated time of arrival (ETA) at the\\ndestination is amended based on actual leg timings. Medium level\\nnavigation is employed for longer route flights such as overseas\\ndeployments or cross country flights.\\nb.\\nLow Level. Low level flying in the RSAF is limited to 500ft AGL\\nor 100ft above highest obstacle (AHO1), whichever is higher, unless\\nauthorised by HQ RSAF. Helicopters are permitted to conduct terrain\\nflying, defined as flying below 200ft AHO. Low level navigation in\\nhelicopters is carried out at 150ft AHO up to a speed of VNE.

Locally, low level\\nnavigation is conducted at 500ft AMSL.\\n15.4\\nFuel Figures. Fuel is vital in navigation planning. The key terms to take\\nnote of are:\\na.\\nFuel required (FR). This is the fuel required to fly the navigation\\nbased on fuel at start-up and thereafter deducting the fuel consumed per\\nleg. Fuel state below FR would mean the helicopter is consuming more\\nfuel than planned. This may occur due to a change in environmental\\nconditions or even AUW. Crew should then closely monitor their FRCS.\\nb.\\nFuel required to complete sortie (FRCS). Also known as the bingo\\nfuel, it is the minimum fuel required to fly the sortie as per the planned\\nnavigation route. It is calculated by starting with the fuel requirements\\n(minimum fuel catering for diversion and other regulatory requirements)\\nat the arrival airfield and adding the fuel needed to complete the route as\\nper the planned navigation route. Dropping to FRCS would require an\\nimmediate recovery as per the planned route.\\nc.\\nChicken fuel. This is the fuel to fly a direct leg to the destination,\\nfrom the furthest point on the navigation route and arrive at the destination\\nbefore reaching minimum fuel. It is typically used for routes in navigation\\ntraining that start and end at the same point.\\n15.5\\nMinimum safe altitude (MSA). This is the altitude that provides a safety\\nheight clearance above the highest obstacle in the area or leg. Leg MSA is derived\\nby taking the highest obstacle within 10nm of each leg of the route, rounded up\\nto the nearest 100ft and adding 1500ft. A similar method can be used for route\\nMSA, based off the highest obstacle within 10nm of the entire route. For cross\\ncountry navigation flights, the appropriate VFR or IFR charts and regulations\\nneed to be referred to for the regulatory requirements of MSA.\\n15.6 Roles. In the helicopter dual crew cockpit, clear designation of roles for\\nnavigation flights is required.

To\\neffectively employ terrain flying, an understanding of the hazards, requirements\\nto plan a route over terrain and employment of flying techniques is vital.\\n17.2\\nObjectives. The objectives in this chapter are; (1) understand the hazards\\nand planning considerations for terrain flying, (2) plan and select a terrain flight\\nroute and (3) conduct terrain flight navigation using the constant speed and\\nconstant pitch technique.\\nTERRAIN FLIGHT PLANNING\\n17.3 Hazards of terrain flying. Prior to embarking on terrain flying, crew must\\nunderstand the potential hazards and watch areas when flying at low heights.\\nThese should be factored in the mission and route planning while being effectively\\nmitigated against prior to execution. The main watch areas are:\\na.\\nWires. Power lines, antennae and communication wires pose a\\ngrave threat to helicopter terrain flying.\\n(1)\\nOn the ground, these should be clearly marked on the\\nhazard map, the flying map and aircraft navigation systems (if\\nable). As a norm, wires should be avoided at all cost.\\n(2)\\nAt low heights, it is difficult to visually acquire wires as\\nthey are thin, long and easily blend in with the surrounding terrain.\\nNever attempt to fly under wires. If there is a need to, cross them\\nobliquely at the poles or pylons at least 50ft above. In addition,\\nslow down when approaching a known area with wires to allow\\nmore reaction time for any unmarked wires.\\n(3)\\nAs a CRM practice, the NFP (navigator) should call out\\n\"wires\" with the distance ahead while the FP should echo or call\\nout \"visual of wires, climbing/crossing at pylon/pole\".\\n17-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Flying at lower heights can lead to reduced\\nforward visibility due to ground dust or pollution, low level mist\\nor fog over a dense canopy and even sun angles during sunrise or\\nsunset. All of these conditions pose as a hazard to terrain flying.\\n(a)\\nTake note of the time of the planned terrain flight\\nto cater for sun angle. Meteorological updates may help\\nalert crew to possible moisture related phenomenon over\\nterrain or the jungle.\\n(b)\\nRoutes nearer populace, deforestation or natural or\\nman-made fires will likely lead to visibility issues. If\\nencountered when flying, reduce speed if able and assess\\nif a higher height can be flown to cater to poorer visibility.\\nb.\\nWind. Terrain flying downwind at slow airspeeds requires more\\npower (due to higher induced power requirements below endurance\\nspeed), thus reducing overall endurance.\\n(1)\\nDowndraft and turbulence are to be expected on the\\nleeward side of hills and over forests during high wind conditions.\\nThe forecast winds and utilisation of on-board systems such as the\\nEFIS will aid to mitigate against this hazard from the planning\\nstage to real time execution. For e.g. in SAFTI LFA, terrain flying\\nnear the leeward side of the terrain feature at LS Lam Kiong when\\nprevailing winds are from the north can lead to crew experiencing\\nsudden descends. This can be mitigated against through route\\nplanning prior to flight. If encountered in flight due to real time\\nweather changes, climb to a higher height and slow down.\\n(2)\\nWind also affects ground track more at lower levels. This\\ncan be demonstrated when flying a race track pattern at terrain\\nflight mode.\\nFigure 17-1: Track drift\\nWind\\nD\\nC\\nB\\nA\\n17-2\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The objective of the recce is to ensure the LP is\\nsuitable for operations. The sequence for the recce is as follows:\\n(1)\\nOrbit. The aerial orbit should be conducted at a suitable\\ndistance from the LP, at 300ft AHO and 50 to 70kts. As a guide,\\nthe LP should be maintained within the side window of the FP's\\nside (See Figure 18-2). The height should be strictly maintained\\nto ensure obstacle clearance while the airspeed should not drop\\nbelow 40kts to ensure effectiveness of the vertical fin. Depending\\non the terrain, the recce may be flown in the form of an orbit, race\\ntrack or figure of eight. AOB can also be varied to ensure the LP\\nis maintained in-sight. Next the SSSSS-W-A-TT (pronounced\\nSWAT) acronym will be utilised to prepare for the approach.\\nThese checks must be conducted in sequence as if one of the\\nconditions cannot be met, there is no longer a need to proceed to\\nthe subsequent item.\\nFigure 18-2: LP orbit for recce\\nKeep the LP within\\nthe window\\narea\\nduring recce.\\n(2)\\nSize.\\nEnsure the LP is big enough for the helicopter to\\nland with 10ft clearance all around.

It is\\ntypically employed for tactical purposes and allows two or more aircraft to\\nmaintain tactical integrity while providing mutual coverage in high threat\\nenvironments. Tactical formation forms the foundation for the employment of\\nformation flying in multi helicopter missions.\\n19.2 Objectives. The objectives are: (1) station keeping in tactical left, tactical\\nright and trail, (2) Turns and basic manoeuvres in a 2-ship formation, (3) stream\\nlanding and take-off, (4) 2-ship contingencies such as aircraft emergencies, no-\\nradio, break and re-join and inadvertent IMC and (5) delivery of the tactical\\nformation mission brief.\\nTYPES OF FORMATION\\n19.3\\nClose formation. Close formations are employed in tactical situations to\\nreduce the radar signature of a multi aircraft package. It is applicable more to fixed\\nwing due to their ability to get close in formation without compromising aircraft\\nperformance or safety. In contrast, helicopters rely on terrain features to minimise\\nsignature. The wake from a helicopter's downwash can also adversely impact\\nother helicopters coming close to it. As such, close formation is not regularly\\npracticed in helicopter flying.\\n19.4 Display formation. The objective of these is to maintain a formation for\\nthe purposes of aerial shows or displays. They are flown anywhere from two to\\nfive rotor spans between the helicopters. The focus is for the wingman or trailing\\nmembers to maintain the designated separation and features for station keeping\\nwhile the lead typically focuses on achieving a TOT. Common display formation\\npositions are echelon left / right, line astern, Vic, diamond and staggered left /\\nright.\\n19.5\\nTactical formation. Tactical formations are used to maximise the tactical\\neffectiveness of multiple helicopters in formation. The helicopters are spaced out\\nsuch that sufficient manoeuvring space is afforded to allow the formation to\\n19-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The basic unit of a tactical formation is a two ship section or\\nelement. Two or more elements make up a flight.\\n19.7\\nSpacing. Helicopters in formation maintain and measure spacing using\\nrotor diameter. Tactical formations (T'form) utilise five rotors as the minimum\\nspacing in the air and minimum of two rotors between taxying helicopters. The\\nfive rotor spacing on the EC can be accurately demonstrated utilising the space\\nbetween two marker boards on the grass lanes in SBAB (See Figure 19-1 below).\\nFigure 19-1: Five rotor spacing on lanes\\n150ft\\n10ft\\n5 rotors = 165ft\\n200ft\\n10ft\\n19.8 Rotor wash.

Forward transitions to the climb by the lead must be done\\nslower than normal. A shallower climb out, slower than normal acceleration and\\nhence lower power should be employed by the lead so as to allow trailing\\nhelicopters to have the required margin to catch up. Conversely, the leader should\\nfly a shallower approach angle, slightly faster than normal approach speed to\\nprevent the wingman from having to rapidly decelerate or even lose sight of the\\nlead at the later stages of the transition to land. This may lead to conditions for\\nvortex ring. The specific techniques to be employed will be covered in succeeding\\nsections of the chapter.\\n19.10 Manoeuvring Limitations. As the EC will be used to introduce basic\\ntactical formation, the lead should limit his turns to 30° AOB to prevent the\\nwingman from having to turn too steeply, especially during inboard turns. Re-\\njoins (from break and re-join) in turns are also disallowed.\\nEXECUTION: GROUND AND DEPARTURE\\n19.11 Mission Preparation. Actual tactical formations are employed during\\nmission oriented training. The considerations would hence be premise on tactical\\nconsiderations utilising the METTT-C framework. For tactical formation training,\\nthe following main factors should be taken into account:\\na.\\nObjectives. Sortie objectives and profiles should be as per detailed\\nin the syllabus or crew training requirements. The wingman and lead's\\nobjectives should both be taken in account when defining objectives for\\nthe mission.\\nb.\\nArea. The largest training area available is preferred for tactical\\nformation. The area should allow straight legs to practice station keeping\\nand sufficient height for manoeuvring in a formation. Locally, LATA 'A'\\nand/or SAFTI LFA are typically assigned for tactical formation sorties.\\nc.\\nHelicopter. Unlike normal sorties, two helicopters are required for\\nthe fulfilment of T'form objectives.

The helicopter's performance which includes\\nairspeed, attitude, height, heading and balance are all monitored through an\\neffective scan pattern of the instruments. The selective radial scan pattern begins\\nwith and is centred on the Attitude Indicator (AI). Thereafter, other instruments\\nsuch as the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) in an instrument approach can be\\nscanned before returning to the AI. In accordance with the RSAF Instrument\\nFlying Reference Manual (RFIRM), 80% of the FP's attention should be\\nmaintained on the AI.\\n20.5 PFD setting. On the EC, the AI is recommended to be set to basic mode\\nfor IF training. This declutters the display from other information such as the drift\\ncursor and provides vital performance information required for basic IF scanning.\\nThe scan pattern (white arrows), parameter indications and markers on the AI are\\nas depicted in Figure 20-1.\\n20-1\\nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) provides a relative\\nbearing to the Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) station signal as well as an audio\\noutput of the received signal.\\n20A.3 Errors and Limitations.\\na.\\nDip Error. The ADF bearing should be considered accurate only\\nwhen the aircraft is in level flight due to \"dip error\" when the aircraft is\\nbanked and most noticeable when the station is on the nose or tail of the\\naircraft. This is because the loop antenna which rotates to sense the\\ndirection of the incoming signal is mounted so that its axis is parallel to\\nthe normal axis of the aircraft.\\nb.\\nShorelines. Shorelines can also refract or bend low frequency radio\\nwaves as they pass from land to water. Pilots flying over water should not\\nuse an NDB signal that crosses over the shoreline to the aircraft at an angle\\nless than 30°. The shoreline has little or no effect on radio waves reaching\\nthe aircraft at angles greater than 30°.\\nc.\\nMountains/Cliffs. Mountains or cliffs can reflect radio waves,\\nproducing a terrain effect. Pilots flying near mountains should use only\\nstrong stations that give definite directional indications, and should not\\nuse stations obstructed by mountains.\\nd.\\nThunderstorms. Water droplets and ice crystals circulating within\\na storm cloud generate wideband noise which may affect accuracy of\\nADF. Lightning within the thunderstorms will also cause the needle to\\npoint for a moment to the bearing of the lightning due to high power\\noutput.\\n20A.4 Phases of an NDB Approach.

The human eye transits from day vision to night vision\\nwhen ambient lighting decreases. The human eye thus utilises slightly different\\ncomponents within the eye to perceive vision. In this mode, certain this false\\ninformation may be perceived due to the limitations of the eyes and unfamiliarity\\nin a night environment. It is therefore imperative that crew understand the\\nillusions one may encounter so as to avoid or be able to recognise the onset of the\\nsymptoms. The following are some possible illusions:\\na.\\nRelative Motion. This illusion occurs when an object within view\\nmoves relative to other objects with no reference to the surroundings. This\\ncan occur in the day when an adjacent large vehicle moves, relative motion\\ncan be perceived as movement of own vehicle in opposite sense. In the\\nfigure shown below, movement of the aircraft in view may be perceived\\nas opposite movement of own aircraft when there is a lack of visible\\nfeatures in peripheral vision.\\nFigure 21A-1: Relative Motion\\nb.\\nConfusion with Ground Lights.
