When torque is applied to the rotor shaft of \\n a helicopter, there is an equal and opposite torque \\nreaction applied to the helicopter by the rotor shaft.  If the torque reaction is not balanced the \\nhelicopter fuselage will turn in the opposite direction to the rotor.  In this chapter, torque reaction and \\nthe solution to it will be discussed.  The forces in  the hover and in forward flight, and transition from \\nforward flight to the hover will also be discussed. \\n \\nTorque Reaction \\n \\n2. The torque reaction on a single rotor helicopter is  shown in \\nFig 1.  A torque compensating force \\nat the tail is the most common method of balancing torque reaction and the force is provided by a tail \\nrotor, shrouded tail rotor (Fenestron), or blown air in the case of No-Tail Rotar (NOTAR) helicopters \\n(Volume 12, Chapter 8). \\n \\n12-3 Fig 1 Torque Reaction \\n \\nTorque\\nReaction\\n  \\n3. The Tail Rotor .  The tail rotor is mounted vertically at the rear of the fuselage and clear of the \\nmain rotor (see Fig 2).  It is driven from the ma in gearbox by a tail rotor drive shaft and geared such \\nthat the shaft revolves at a very high speed com pared to the main gearbox and the tail rotor.  The \\nreason for an increase in the rpm of the tail rotor driv e shaft is to allow the construction of it to be \\nflimsier because the torque, which is directly propor tional to rpm, is reduced.  It is also easier to \\nbalance the shaft if it rotates at high rpm. \\n \\n12-3 Fig 2 Conventional Tail Rotor \\n \\nControl Shaft\\nSpiderTail Cone\\n \\n \\nRevised Jul 12  Page 2 of \\n18', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If the helicopter is loaded to position the CG \\nimmediately below the blades’ axis of rotation, and discounting downdraft on any horizontal surfaces, no \\nchange in fuselage attitude will occur when the helicopter  leaves the ground, Fig 6b.  If, however, the CG \\nis not below the axis of rotation, Fig 6c, a couple will exist between total rotor thrust and the weight, and \\nthe fuselage will pitch until both forces are in line, Fi g 6d.  It should be noted that a helicopter in the hover \\noften adopts a nose-up attitude in any case, irrespec \\ntive of the position of the CG.

      "The article discusses the principles of helicopter movement, specifically focusing on hovering and horizontal movement. It explains the process of take-off and climb to a free air hover, detailing how a force greater than the weight of the helicopter must be produced to lift it off the ground. This force acts vertically downwards through the aircraft's center of gravity. The article also discusses how the Total Rotor Thrust (TRT) and the All Up Weight (AUW) of the helicopter interact during this process. Additionally, it covers the effect of the Rate of Climb (ROC) on the induced airflow, angle of attack, and total rotor thrust.\n"
